// Tests for the two things that decide whether curation works for a stranger.
//
// Everything else in this product is verifiable: a transcript either parses or
// it does not, a section either opens or it does not. Curation quality is not
// checkable by any test, on any machine — which is exactly why the two
// mechanisms that shape it need guarding, because nothing downstream will
// report it when they break.
//
// One ships taste by example, since rules alone produce median pages. The other
// collects the user's own corrections so a schema that is somebody else's taste
// becomes theirs without them ever having to write it down.
