// Tests for `--at`, which every command accepted and almost none obeyed.
//
// `detect()` took no arguments. `decline` and `uninstall` both called it as
// `detect({ at })` — passing an object to a function with no parameters, which
// JavaScript does in silence — and `sync` never forwarded the flag at all. So
// three commands accepted a path, discarded it, and acted on whichever brain
// the pointer named. Nothing threw. Every existing test happened to point
// `--at` at the same brain the pointer already named, so all of them passed.
//
// What that cost, in the order it matters:
//
//   read --at ~/typo --search x   answered "Nothing in the brain matches. Say
//                                 so plainly; do not answer from memory." at
//                                 exit 0, having never opened a brain. A
//                                 retrieval failure wearing the shape of an
//                                 answer is the worst output this tool makes.
//   sync --at <other brain>       staged the batch into the pointer's brain.
//   uninstall --at <anywhere>     printed "YOUR BRAIN IS UNTOUCHED" over a path
//                                 the user had not named.
//
// The rule now: `--at` names a brain OUTRIGHT and is never quietly replaced by
// the pointer's. A path holding no brain is refused by name, because carrying on
// against a brain nobody named is the failure the flag exists to prevent.
//
// Two deliberate exceptions are pinned here too, because both look like the bug
// from outside and a later reader will want to "fix" them:
//   - `init`/`scaffold` ask a different question — which brain already EXISTS —
//     and enforce one brain per person against the pointer, not against a flag.
//   - `uninstall` never refuses. Leaving must always finish.
