// THE GUARD: one invocation, and setup refuses rather than naming a dead one
// ==========================================================================
//
// This is defect 3 of the first outside install, and by 2026-08-29 it had
// appeared three times: the pointer (fixed 08-28, in reach.js and NOWHERE
// ELSE), then `uninstall`, then thirty-one other sites found by looking.
//
// Each time the fix was applied where the bug was REPORTED rather than where it
// lived, so each fix was correct and the class survived it. What was missing
// was never care -- it was a check that does not depend on anyone remembering.
//
// HOW THE PROPERTY CHANGED, 2026-08-29. The old guard ran every command on a
// PATH with nothing installed and asserted that no line named a bare
// `exposurie <cmd>` -- because a second, slower invocation existed to be named
// instead. That second form is gone. There is one spelling of every command on
// every machine, so "which form did it print" is no longer a question a test
// can ask.
//
// The invariant underneath it is unchanged and is now asserted directly: NO
// FILE IS EVER WRITTEN NAMING A COMMAND THE MACHINE DOES NOT HAVE. It is kept
// by refusing instead of by translating -- `scaffold` declines on a bare PATH
// and writes nothing at all. That is a stronger claim than the old one and a
// much easier one to check.
//
// And the second guard here exists because the removal is the kind that gets
// quietly undone: nothing this product prints, or writes into a brain, may
// contain the string `npx` ever again.
