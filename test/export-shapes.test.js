// Tests for the shapes an export actually arrives in.
//
// A 1,164-conversation ChatGPT export sat in Downloads on the first machine
// somebody who did not build this ever installed it on, and the tool never saw
// it. Not a parse failure — the parser was correct and had never been given a
// chance to prove it. Two reasons, both about shape:
//
//   1. OpenAI delivered it ALREADY UNPACKED, into a dated folder, and
//      `findExports` only ever looked at `*.zip`.
//   2. Inside there was no `conversations.json`. It was split across
//      `conversations-000.json` ... `conversations-011.json`, and the sniffer
//      required that literal name.
//
// It reached the parser only because it was repackaged by hand first, and then
// read 1,157 of 1,164 with no error. **A reader nothing reaches is worth what a
// broken one is, and it is harder to notice, because everything it does report
// is right.**
//
// So these tests are about DISCOVERY, and they are written per shape rather
// than per vendor. Anthropic splits large accounts across numbered zips and
// anybody can unzip either vendor's download by hand, so the four shapes below
// are one bug with four faces — and fixing it for ChatGPT alone would have left
// the same hole open on the other side, which is exactly what happened the
// first time, when `batch-000N` was handled and `conversations-000.json` was not.
