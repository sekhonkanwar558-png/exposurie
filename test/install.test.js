// THE BUG THESE PIN. The pointer written into every client's global
// instructions names a command, and for a whole release the documented way in
// left no such command on PATH. So setup wrote an instruction naming nothing,
// into the one file that loads on every message forever, and it failed
// SILENTLY: prose naming a missing command does not error, it simply never
// runs. Retrieval is the whole product and it was dead at rest.
//
// It was answered twice. First by carrying a second, slower invocation to name
// instead; then, on 2026-08-29, by deleting that second form and having
// `scaffold` REFUSE until the real command exists. These pin the second answer,
// which is the stronger one: there is no file left to be wrong.
//
// It could not be found on the machine this was built on, where the binary is
// on PATH for unrelated reasons. It took a real install on somebody else's
// laptop. So these tests do the thing that machine did: run the real CLI with a
// PATH that has no exposurie in it, and read what landed in the user's files.

// Defect 3 of the first outside install was the pointer naming `exposurie` on
// a machine where the documented way in left no such command behind. That was
// fixed in reach.js and NOWHERE ELSE, so the same literal stayed in the output
// of `init`, `scaffold` and `help` -- including in the one sentence that
// promises the whole thing is reversible.
//
// It is worse here than it was in the pointer, for one reason. Everywhere else
// an agent reads the output, and an agent that has just run the tool knows the
// invocation that worked and can recover from "command not found". `uninstall`
// is documented as the user's own -- typed by a person, in a terminal, with no
// agent involved -- so a name that does not resolve has nobody to notice it,
// at the exact moment somebody has decided to stop trusting the tool.
//
// WHAT THIS ASSERTS NOW, and why it changed on 2026-08-29. It used to assert
// that no output named `exposurie uninstall` on a machine without it, which was
// satisfiable only because a second, slower invocation existed to print
// instead. That form is gone: there is one spelling of every command, so `help`
// naming `exposurie uninstall` on a machine that has not installed yet is
// correct rather than a bug -- it is what the command WILL be, one line from
// now.
//
// The property that still matters, and is the one worth keeping: nobody is ever
// left holding a command they cannot run with no way forward. So any output
// that names one on an uninstalled machine must also name the install line.
// That is a weaker claim about spelling and a stronger one about the reader.
