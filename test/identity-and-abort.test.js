// Two smaller things the first outside install turned up, and one shape between
// them: work that cannot be taken back.
//
//   IDENTITY. A transcript is identified by its path, and a path is not unique.
//   An agent isolating one client by faking `HOME` reached the same files under
//   a second name, and the resume offsets are keyed by name — so the same
//   conversation was read twice, and would be written into somebody's brain
//   twice. The workaround that surfaced it does not matter: `~/.claude`
//   symlinked onto another drive is an ordinary thing to do.
//
//   ABORT. A batch staged by accident had no way out. Running `sync` again only
//   stages a second one beside it, `--done` refuses to close it — correctly,
//   since the pages were never written — and the folder and the pending record
//   sit there forever, with nothing to tell an agent which batch is live.
//
// The reason abort is safe to offer at all is the property that makes `--done`
// strict: the cutoff only ever moves on evidence. A batch that was never closed
// advanced nothing, so throwing it away cannot lose a conversation. The output
// says so, and the test below makes the promise true rather than reassuring.
