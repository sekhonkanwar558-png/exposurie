// Tests for the other half of the reminder: taking it back.
//
// Every open human step is mirrored to a file in the brain, because auto mode
// blows past a terminal and a file is still there tomorrow. That half was wired
// into both commands from the start. The half that removes the file once the
// step is actually done was written, exported, tested by nobody, and CALLED BY
// NOBODY for the whole life of the feature.
//
// What a user got: they set `cleanupPeriodDays` for real, the tool correctly
// stopped asking — and a file stayed in their brain saying "Waiting on you",
// directly under a line promising it would delete itself. Wrong in the worst
// place, since the brain is the thing they are being taught to trust, and it is
// visible in Obsidian next to real pages.
//
// Correct component, no caller. That is the class this repo keeps finding, and
// it is the second instance in one session — the decline filter read a `vault`
// that neither caller passed. So the fix is not "call reap()": it is that
// writing and removing are ONE call, and a caller cannot do half of it.
