// Tests for the first run reading ALL of it.
//
// THE BUG THESE PIN. A batch is bounded so it fits in the AGENT's context — it
// was never a limit on how much of a person's history gets read. The loop is
// what makes those two different things, and the loop was a sentence of prose
// under the plan: "Run sync again for the next batch."
//
// Rule 2 of the output contract says what happens to those — an instruction
// buried in prose is an instruction skipped — and it was. On a real first run
// over 165 sessions the agent filed the newest seven, reported that 158
// remained, and stopped to ask whether to continue. The backlog only drained
// because the person typed "get each and every session" and then "continue" six
// more times. Every batch after the first was material they had already asked
// for, and the tool turned a decision it owns into a question it billed to them.
//
// So: the continuation is a NUMBERED STEP, it says not to ask, and it stops
// appearing the moment nothing is waiting.
