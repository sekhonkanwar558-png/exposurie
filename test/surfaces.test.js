// Tests for the two surfaces a person and an agent can REACH FOR.
//
// The pointer in reach.js is handed to an agent on every message and has its
// own suite. These are the opposite: a skill the model picks up when it is
// asked in words, and a slash command a person types when they have decided
// to. Nothing was ever installed for either, which was half of item 3 of the
// first outside install — the report said the slash command was never
// installed, and the finding underneath was that there was none to install.
//
// What is pinned here is mostly not "it writes a file". It is the four ways
// this specific feature goes wrong quietly:
//
//   - naming a command that does not exist on the machine it was written on
//     (the exact failure that killed retrieval on every npx install),
//   - burying the loop in prose so a backlog drains one batch and stops,
//   - paying the always-loaded budget twice for a job the pointer already does,
//   - reaching one directory too far on the way out.
