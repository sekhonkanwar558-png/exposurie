// Tests for the third state: a step the user said NO to.
//
// The catalog's rule is that "done" is detected and never marked, and every
// other test in this repo defends that. This file defends the one case the rule
// cannot cover: a decision leaves nothing on disk to detect, so without a place
// to put it, "repeat until done" becomes "repeat forever" for anything a person
// has decided against. That is the cries-wolf failure the whole product fears,
// reaching the one component that talks directly to a human.
//
// It was live before this shipped. Claude Code's retention step resolves only
// at a year or more; a user who keeps the 30-day default on purpose — because
// they sync often enough that it never bites — got the same request at the top
// of every command, forever, with no way to answer it.
//
// Four things have to hold, and each is a test below: the refusal is honoured,
// it is honoured ONLY for the step refused, it never masquerades as done, and
// it is undone by deleting a file rather than by remembering a command.
