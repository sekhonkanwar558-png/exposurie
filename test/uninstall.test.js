// Tests for leaving.
//
// remove() in reach.js was written with the reason attached — "a pointer we
// cannot remove is a pointer we have imposed" — and then no command called it
// for the life of the product. The pointer could go into every client's global
// instructions file and never come back out, which makes that sentence a claim
// the code did not support.
//
// Three properties, and the whole trust argument rests on them:
//
//   1. everything of ours goes          — including files we created
//   2. nothing of the user's moves      — byte-identical, not merely intact
//   3. the brain is never touched       — not by default, not by any flag
//
// The third is the one worth being paranoid about. Uninstall is the only place
// in this product where "remove what you installed" could be read as "remove
// the thing you built", and those are opposite acts. A test that only checked
// the folder still exists would pass on a version that emptied it, so the pages
// are counted too.
