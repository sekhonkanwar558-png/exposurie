// test failed — the suite was 318 green while all of them were live. That is
// the only kind of bug left in a suite this healthy, and it is exactly the
// kind that survives a release nobody is going to patch for months.
//
// The worst of them is the one that reads best: `init` printed a `scaffold
// --at` command with an unquoted path, so on any machine whose owner has a
// space in their name the first command of the product built the brain in the
// wrong place and reported success.
