// Claude Code deletes its own transcripts after `cleanupPeriodDays`, default
// 30. That is a fact about the machine, not about this tool, and it was found
// the only way it could be: by pointing the reader at three real project
// folders and finding no transcripts in any of them, on a machine whose oldest
// surviving file was 29 days old.
//
// The step therefore has to be right about three things, and each is a test:
// it must NOT fire where the deletion does not happen, it must resolve from
// disk rather than from a claim, and the edit must be the agent's rather than
// something read aloud to a person.
