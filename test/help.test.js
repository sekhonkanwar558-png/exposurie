// Tests for `--help`, which used to be an instruction rather than a question.
//
// The dispatcher read `positionals[0] ?? (values.help ? 'help' : 'init')`, so a
// command name always won and the flag was parsed and then thrown away. Asking
// what a command does ran it. On the first install on somebody else's machine
// `exposurie sync --help` staged a real batch, and the agent driving the setup
// had to go and clean up work it had never meant to start.
//
// Nothing crashed and no number was wrong — the same shape as every other
// defect that install found. The tool did exactly what it was told; it was told
// the wrong thing by its own argument parsing.
//
// So the property under test is not "help prints help". It is that ASKING
// CANNOT ACT: after `--help`, the machine is byte-for-byte what it was. That is
// checked against the whole home directory rather than the brain, because the
// commands with the most to lose here write outside it — `scaffold` creates a
// second brain and registers it with every client, `uninstall` takes the
// pointer back out — and it is checked for every name in the command table, so
// a command added later cannot reintroduce this by forgetting a flag.
