// Tests for WHICH human steps a given machine is asked for.
//
// THE BUG THESE PIN, measured on a real laptop on 2026-08-26. `init` detected 6
// Claude Code sessions, 165 Codex and 11 Cursor — correctly — and then asked
// for a claude.ai export the person did not have, offered to change Claude
// Code's retention to protect 3% of their history, and NEVER asked for the
// ChatGPT export sitting in their Downloads with 1,164 conversations in it.
//
// Nothing was mis-detected. Every gate read the counts as a boolean, `present`,
// so six stale transcripts outvoted 165. Worse, the two export gates were
// written as each other's negation on that same boolean, which made "asked for
// the wrong one" and "never asked for the right one" a single bug that no
// machine could exhibit only half of.
//
// So the matrix below is the point of this file: every mix of clients, and what
// each one is owed. The first test is that laptop, reconstructed.
