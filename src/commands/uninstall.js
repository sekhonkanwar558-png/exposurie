// `exposurie uninstall` — take back everything this tool put on the machine.
//
// remove() in reach.js says it plainly: a pointer we cannot remove is a pointer
// we have imposed. It was written, it was correct, and for the whole life of
// the product nothing called it — so the honest version of "we own the failure
// path" had no command behind it.
//
// THE ONE COMMAND, AND IT IS THE USER'S. Every other command here talks to an
// agent, which is right when the agent is doing work on their behalf. Leaving
// is different: a person who wants this gone should not have to open a coding
// agent and ask it nicely. So this one is typed by a human, in a terminal, and
// speaks to that human — no "TELL YOUR USER", no relay, no plan for something
// else to execute. It works the same when an agent runs it, because plain
// second-person prose is the one register both can read.
//
//   exposurie uninstall
//
// It is the counterpart to `scaffold`, not a new recurring command: setup is
// typed once and teardown is typed once. What a person types over and over is
// still `sync`.
//
// THE RULE IT EXISTS TO KEEP: it removes what WE wrote, and never what the user
// did. Their brain is pages they and their agent authored, and it is the entire
// point of the tool — deleting it here would make uninstalling the most
// destructive thing exposurie can do, which is the opposite of why being able
// to leave builds any trust at all. The brain is reported, not touched, and the
// tool says where it is on the way out.
