// `exposurie sync` — find what is new, stage it, and never lose it.
//
// Sync is deliberately two halves. The deterministic half is here: find what is
// new, apply the exclusion gate, read conversation out of the transcripts, and
// write a batch. The other half — folding it into pages — is an LLM job, and it
// lives as a procedure file in the brain, so no client's skill format is
// load-bearing and the user can change how their own brain gets written.
//
// Three properties this has to have, and each is a decision:
//
//   NEWEST FIRST, AND RESUMABLE. History is not truncated, because "we only
//   read the last 30 days" is a quality compromise. Instead it is ORDERED, in
//   bounded batches, with the remainder reported. The first run costs the user
//   real quota on their own plan, and one long unbounded job at minute one —
//   before they have any reason to trust this — is how a tool gets uninstalled.
//
//   THE CUTOFF MOVES LAST. It is the only record of what has been read, so
//   advancing it before the pages exist turns an interrupted sync into
//   permanent, silent data loss.
//
//   AND IT MOVES ON EVIDENCE, NOT ON A CLAIM. `--done` checks that the brain
//   actually changed. Nobody ticks a box, and an agent cannot close a batch by
//   assuming it worked.
//
// AND IT CURATES, EVERY TIME. This is the one command a person types after
// setup, so everything that makes the brain better lives inside it rather than
// beside it. Curation is not a phase that starts once the brain is a mess — by
// then the mess IS the brain — so it runs from the very first batch onward, on
// exactly one path per invocation: after `--done`, when pages have just been
// written, and on the nothing-new path, so that typing the command when there
// is no new material still leaves the brain better than it found it.

 * written — so the folder and the pending record sit there permanently, and
 * an agent reading the brain finds two staged batches with nothing to say which
 * is live.
 *
 * The reason this is safe to offer at all is the same property that makes
 * `--done` strict: THE CUTOFF ONLY EVER MOVES ON EVIDENCE. A batch that was
 * never closed never advanced anything, so discarding it cannot lose a
 * conversation — every session in it is still unread and comes back on the
 * next sync. That is stated in the output, because a person about to discard
 * something needs to know what it costs before they believe it costs nothing.
 *
 * It removes the staged folder and the pending record. It does not touch the
 * cutoff, and it does not touch a single page.
