// `exposurie scaffold` — create the brain, and hand over the half that is theirs.
//
// This is the first command that writes anything, and it has one rule above all
// others: IT NEVER OVERWRITES. Every file it copies in becomes the user's — a
// schema their agent tuned to their life is the goal, not drift — so a second
// run tops up what is missing and reports what it left alone. Clobbering a
// tuned schema on a re-run would destroy exactly the thing the ownership split
// exists to protect.
//
// It also never creates a backup remote. The asymmetry decides it: no backup
// and the disk dies is bad and known; we push and a visibility flag is wrong
// once and every conversation the user has ever had with an AI is public,
// irreversibly, and by our hand.
