//
// This exists because of a specific failure the product had: `init` printed
// `RUN: exposurie scaffold` months before `scaffold` existed, so an agent
// following the plan hit "no such command" and had nothing to do with that.
// A tool whose own output names a command it does not have has taught the
// agent reading it that the plan is not to be trusted.
//
// So the dispatcher, the help text and the test that greps every printed plan
// all read this same table. A command exists here or the output cannot name it.

/**
 * `--version`, answered like `--help` and rendered like every other command.
 *
 * It carries the state line, which is not decoration: `help` was the one thing
 * in this product that returned no state, and that stayed invisible until the
 * flag reaching it started working — at which point the page a confused agent
 * lands on was printing "no brain yet" to people who had one. A flag answered
 * beside it must not repeat that.
 *
 * WHAT IT SAYS BEYOND THE NUMBER, and why it is not padding. The question
 * behind "what version am I on" is almost always "do I have the fix", and the
 * single most useful neighbouring fact is whether this copy is really INSTALLED
 * — because that is what decides whether setup can write a pointer at all. It
 * is the one piece of information
 * that would have shortened the first outside install, printed at the moment
 * somebody is already asking about their copy of the tool.
 *
 * `--json` gives `{ "version": "1.1.0", "exit": 0 }` for anything scripting
 * against it, because the state line comes first in human output, always, and
 * that is a rule rather than an accident.
