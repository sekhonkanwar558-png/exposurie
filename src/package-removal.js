// Taking the package itself off the machine, as part of `uninstall`.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Leaving used to be two commands: `exposurie uninstall` took
// back what we wrote into the user's agent, and `npm uninstall -g` took the
// package off their PATH. The README printed both and explained the split.
//
// His ruling, 2026-08-30, reading that section: *"it shows exposurie uninstall
// as well as npm uninstall, i just clearly want one install, one sync and one
// uninstall command everywhere."*
//
// He is right, and it is the same defect as the npx one a day earlier: two ways
// to do one job, with the difference between them explained rather than
// removed. The design law says WE DECIDE, THE USER IS NEVER HANDED THE
// QUESTION -- and "which of these two lines do I still need to run" is exactly
// a question being handed over, at the one moment somebody has decided to stop
// trusting us and is least willing to read.
//
// THE GUARD, and it is the whole reason this is its own module. `npm uninstall
// -g` resolves ITS OWN global prefix, which has nothing to do with the sandbox
// HOME a test hands us. A test that spawns `uninstall` would therefore reach
// past its sandbox and delete the developer'''s real global install -- the suite
// eating the machine it runs on.
//
// So the package is removed ONLY when the `exposurie` we resolved on PATH sits
// beside an npm-installed copy of this package, checked against npm'''s own
// on-disk layout -- see npmOwns() below, which carries why that is a filesystem
// check and not a question put to npm. The safety property and the correctness
// property are the same check, which is why it is trustworthy rather than
// merely careful: a copy npm did not place is not a copy npm should be asked to
// remove.

/**
 * Is the `exposurie` we resolved on PATH one that npm installed globally?
 *
 * Answered from the DISK LAYOUT rather than by asking npm, and the first
 * version did ask npm -- `npm prefix -g`, compared against the binary's own
 * directory. It was wrong in a way worth recording, because nothing about it
 * looked wrong:
 *
 *   npm SCRUBS ITS OWN OUTPUT. npm auth tokens are UUIDs, so @npmcli/redact
 *   replaces anything UUID-shaped with `***` -- including a UUID that is merely
 *   part of a directory path. `npm prefix -g` under such a path returns a
 *   string that is not a path at all, the comparison fails, and the package is
 *   silently left behind while the tool reports it did the right thing.
 *
 * It surfaced in a sandbox whose path carried a session UUID, but it is a real
 * user's bug too, and it is the class this project keeps meeting: TRUSTING A
 * TOOL'S HUMAN-READABLE OUTPUT AS DATA. The fix is not to parse it more
 * carefully; it is not to need it.
 *
 * The layout npm guarantees is enough, and it answers a sharper question than
 * the prefix ever did -- not "is this binary in the folder npm uses" but "is
 * this binary sitting next to an npm-installed copy of OUR package":
 *
 *   Windows   <prefix>\exposurie.cmd    + <prefix>\node_modules\@sekhon\exposurie
 *   POSIX     <prefix>/bin/exposurie    + <prefix>/lib/node_modules/@sekhon/exposurie
 *
 * THIS IS ALSO THE TEST GUARD, and that the two are one check is why it can be
 * trusted rather than merely reviewed. `npm uninstall -g` resolves its own
 * global prefix, which has nothing to do with a sandbox HOME -- so a test that
 * spawned `uninstall` would reach past its sandbox and delete the developer's
 * real install. A fake binary in a temp directory has no `node_modules` beside
 * it, so this returns false, nothing is spawned, and the suite cannot eat the
 * machine it runs on. A copy npm did not place is not a copy npm should be
 * asked to remove.

 * Is the copy npm installed the same copy that is executing right now?

 *
 * WHAT IT COST TO LEARN. The first version guarded only on npm's layout, which
 * covers a spawned test handed a fake binary in a temp directory. It does not
 * cover a test that IMPORTS `uninstall()` and calls it with the real
 * environment -- there the binary is real, npm really did place it, and the
 * guard correctly says yes. `test/uninstall.test.js` does exactly that, so
 * `npm test` deleted the developer's own global install, and the next 93 tests
 * failed because `scaffold` refuses without one. The suite ate the machine it
 * was running on, which is the precise failure the guard existed to prevent,
 * arriving through the one door it did not cover.
 *
 * A checkout is not its installed copy, so running the suite from the repo now
 * declines by construction rather than by anyone remembering to inject a stub.
 *
 * `realpathSync` matters: a linked install (`npm link`, the developer's own
 * machine) points the installed path AT the checkout, and those two really are
 * the same copy. Resolving the link says so, which is right -- somebody who
 * linked it globally did install it globally, and `uninstall` should take it
 * back. Comparing the raw strings would call that foreign and leave it behind.
