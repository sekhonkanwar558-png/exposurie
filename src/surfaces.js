// The two surfaces a person and an agent can REACH FOR, as opposed to the one
// they are handed on every message.
//
// reach.js writes a pointer into each client's global instructions file. That
// file is paid for on every message of every project forever, so the pointer is
// a few hundred bytes and carries a pointer rather than content. It has to be
// small, and small is the whole reason it can only ever name one command.
//
// A skill and a slash command invert that arithmetic. A skill's DESCRIPTION is
// always-loaded and its body is not; a command costs nothing at all until a
// person types it. So the procedure that never fitted in the pointer fits here,
// and it fits at full length.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. It was item 3 of the first outside install, and only
// half of it got fixed. The report said the slash command was never installed;
// the finding underneath was that THERE IS NONE. What shipped in August fixed
// the pointer that named a missing command, and left the missing command.
//
// It was not buildable before that fix either, which is the part worth keeping.
// A skill body's one useful line is `RUN: exposurie sync`, and under the
// documented `npx` install nothing of that name is on PATH — so a skill written
// then would have failed exactly the way the pointer did: correct prose naming
// a command that is not there, erroring never, running never. Making the
// permanent install the documented path is what made this surface possible.
//
// THE DIVISION OF LABOUR, so no two of the three do the same job:
//
//   pointer   always-loaded, every message   RETRIEVAL. `read --search`.
//   skill     description always-loaded      THE SYNC PROCEDURE, agent-invoked
//                                            when the user asks for it in words.
//   command   nothing until typed            THE SYNC PROCEDURE, user-invoked,
//                                            one token, no explaining.
//
// The skill deliberately does NOT trigger on "a question about the user" — the
// pointer already fires there, on every message, and a second always-loaded
// trigger for one job is the context budget being spent twice for nothing.

 * nothing reads rather than corrupting a config another tool depends on. A
 * client whose ROOT is absent is skipped entirely, so an entry costs nothing on
 * a machine without that client.
 *
 * `verified` means the directory was OBSERVED on a real machine — not that the
 * client is documented to read it. Two of these were observed here, with other
 * people's skills already living in them; the rest are the client's convention
 * and say so in the output.
 *
 * OpenCode has a row in reach.js and none here on purpose. There, four clients
 * are three conventions because `AGENTS.md` is a filename several of them
 * genuinely share, so an entry for OpenCode is an informed guess. Here there is
 * nothing to inform it: no shared convention, no observed directory, no name to
 * run ahead to. Guessing a path with no basis is invention rather than running
 * ahead of confirmation, and the two are not the same thing.
